    "# CarND-Path-Planning-Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains C++ code for implementation of Path Planner. This path of waypoints is used to fed to the controller module of a car running on a highway. This task was implemented to partially fulfill Term-III goals of Udacity's self driving car nanodegree program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical module in the working of a self driving car system is the path planning module. It is essentially the brain of the whole eco system. Path planning module derives the path to be followed by car ahead of time. This path has information on mostly position and velocity of the car in the future. This information acts as an input to the controller module. The controller modules then ensures there is minimum deviation in the planned path and the executed path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following parameters serve as an input to the path planning module:\n",
    "  1. Map of the environment with start and goal location. This is the global map having information on the best possible route from the start to the destination.\n",
    "  2. Local map of th environment. This map is a subset and a more detailed version of the global map and has information about the landmarks in the area surrounded by car. This map changes when the car moves.\n",
    "  3. Position of the other vehicles, pedestrians, animals, traffic lights, etc. in the local map. This information is deduced by creating point clouds from the data received from sensor fusion module.\n",
    "  4. Current position of the car in the local map. This is derived by the localisation module.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Information from all the inputs is then used to perfom following tasks:\n",
    "  1. Prediction - This involves predicting the behavior of car and other elements in the surrounding\n",
    "  2. Behavior planning - This involves plannning the possible states of the car. For e.g.: Acceleration, Deceleration, lane change, left and right turns, etc.\n",
    "  3. Trajectory planning - This involves determining the trajectory of the car for a few meters ahead of it based on the speed limit, traffic and capabilities of the car.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Working of Path Planning Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Path planner assumes that the controller module of car is loss less and that it follows the trajectory perfectly. Hence, a working implementation of path planner is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Creating smooth transition path from current location of the few meters ahead towards the goal\n",
    "  2. Providing discrete waypoints having information on the desired velocity of the car at that location\n",
    "  3. Updation of the path in real time based on changes in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. A successful path planner should be able to keep inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic all by using localization, sensor fusion, and map data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of a circular track was achieved in the [Udacity's self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2). While Path planner was implmented in C++, the simulator communicated to C++ code with the help of [uWebSockets library](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets). Following parameters were received from the simulator for each communication ping:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"x\") The car's x position in map coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"y\") The car's y position in map coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"s\") The car's s position in frenet coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"d\") The car's d position in frenet coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"yaw\") The car's yaw angle in the map\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"speed\") The car's speed in MPH\n",
    "\n",
    "### Previous path data given to the Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along the path has processed since last time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"previous_path_x\") The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"previous_path_y\") The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous path's end s and d values\n",
    "(\"end_path_s\") The previous list's last point's frenet s value\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"end_path_d\") The previous list's last point's frenet d value\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)\n",
    "(\"sensor_fusion\") A 2d vector of cars and then that car's (car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final implementation consisted of following major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### 1. Creation of smooth trajectory ahead of car\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this step, C++ [spline tool](http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) was used to interpolate a smooth curve out of 5 anchor points defined on the path ahead of the car. The 5 anchor points were chosen as follows:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  a. A point behind current car's location\n",
    "  b. Current location of car\n",
    "  c. Point ahead of car by 30m\n",
    "  d. Point ahead of car by 60m\n",
    "  e. Point ahead of car by 90m\n",
    "\n",
    "  The speed limit for car was 50 MPH. Hence, the path planner followed a safe speed limit of 48 MPH and determined 30 waypoints ahead of car on the smooth curve by spline.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  C++ code for this task is implemented from line 375 to line 503 in main.cpp.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### 2. Prediction of behavior of other cars on the highway\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this step, sensor fusion data passed by simulator was used to find cars ahead, in the right lane and in the left lane of the car.   Following were the flags raised to warn the path planner of the behavior of others cars on the same side of the road:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  a. is_car_ahead - This flag was raised when the self driving car was approaching a car ahead of it in the same lane and the distance between them was less than 30m\n",
    "  b. is_car_right - This flag was raised when cars in the lane to the right of self driving car were either in the range of 30m ahead or 15m behind\n",
    "  c. is_car_left - This flag was raised when cars in the lane to the left of self driving car were either in the range of 30m ahead or 15m behind\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This information was prepared to be consumed by the behavior planner. Behavior of cars on the other side of the road were ignored for the scope of this project.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  C++ code for this task is implemented from line 283 to line 339 in main.cpp.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### 3. Determination of behavior of self driving car\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this step, the car followed a less complex version of finite state machine having following states:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  a. Accelerate - Continue in current lane and accelerate reaching speed limit\n",
    "  b. Decelerate - Slow down in current lane in order to avoid collision with car ahead\n",
    "  c. Lane change Left - Change lane to left with current speed if not in leftmost lane\n",
    "  d. Lane change RIght - Change lane to right with current speed if not in rightmost lane\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This information was prepared to be consumed by the trajectory planner to enhance the basic trajectory already devised in step 1.\n",
